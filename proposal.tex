    \begin{abstract}
        Let $F$ be a free pro-$p$ non-abelian group, and let $\Delta$ be a commutative Noetherian complete local ring with maximal ideal $I$ such that
        $\mathrm{char}(\Delta/I)=p$.\\
        Then consider the group
        \[GL_2^1(\Delta) = \mathrm{ker}\left( GL_2(\Delta) \xrightarrow{\Delta\to\Delta/I} GL_2(\Delta/I) \right)\]
        A.N.\ Zubkov showed that $F$ cannot be continuously embedded in $GL_2^1(\Delta)$ for $p\neq 2$.\\
        D.\ Ben-Ezra and E.\ Zelmanov showed that $F$ cannot be continuously embedded in $GL_2^1(\Delta)$ for $p = 2$ and $\mathrm{char}(\Delta)=2$.\\
        In this paper we are going to prove the same result for $\mathrm{char}(\Delta)=4$.\\
        In the second part we will investigate the connection between PI-theory and the old-standing Gelfand conjecture.
    \end{abstract}


    \section{Introduction}

    \subsection{On non-linearity of free non-abelian pro-$p$ groups}
    The problem of linearity of topological groups is natural and has studied for many years.
    It is well known that discrete free groups are linear (\cite).
    Furthermore, they can be embedded in $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.

    So it's also quite natural to ask whether a free pro-$p$ non-abelian group is linear.

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        Commutative Noetherian complete local ring $\Delta$ with a maximal ideal $I$ is called pro-$p$ ring if $\Delta/I$ is a finite field of characteristic $p$.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    Consider the congruence subgroup:
    \[GL_2^1(\Delta) = \mathrm{ker}\left( GL_2(\Delta) \xrightarrow{\Delta\to\Delta/I} GL_2(\Delta/I) \right)\]
    One can see that $GL_2^1(\Delta)$ is a pro-p-group.
    So the main conjecture of this theory can be formulated as following:
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{conjecture*}
        Non-abelian free pro-$p$ group cannot be continuously embedded in $GL_d^1(\Delta)$ for any pro-$p$ ring $\Delta$.
    \end{conjecture*}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    There are a lot of partial results for certain $\Delta, d, p$.
    Let us list them out.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In 1987, A.N\ Zubkov showed (\cite) that for $d=2, p\neq2$ the conjecture holds true.
        \item In 1999, using the deep results of Pink (\cite), Y.\ Barnea, M.\ Larsen (\cite) proved the conjecture for $\Delta=\left( \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \right)[[t]]$
        \item In 1991, J.D.\ Dixon, A.\ Mann, M.P.F.\ du Sautoy, D.\ Segal (\cite) proved conjecture for $\Delta=\mathbb{Z}_p$, $GL_d^1(\mathbb{Z}_p)=\mathrm{ker}\left( GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_p) \xrightarrow{\mathbb{Z}_p\to\mathbb{F}_p} GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p) \right)$
        \item In 2020, D.\ Ben-Ezra, E.\ Zelmanov showed (\cite) that for $d=2, p=2$ and $\mathrm{char}(\Delta)=2$  the conjecture holds true.
        \item In ..., E.\ Zelmanov (\cite) announced that conjecture holds true for $p\gg d$.
    \end{itemize}

    One can see that this subject has be researched by many mathematicians.
    So first of all we are going to give a review of their methods.

    We will focus mostly on Zubkov's and Ben-Ezra, Zelmanov's methods.\\
    Zubkov's proof based on standard approaches of commutative algebra and the idea of generic matrices.
    Zelmanov and Ben-Ezra adopted Zubkov's method for the case $p=2$ using the trace identities which dates back to polynomial identities theory (PI-theory for short).

    Additionally, we intend to extend Zelmanov and Ben-Ezra's approach for $d=2, p=2$ and $\mathrm{char}(\Delta)=4$.
    We also hope that it will be quite easy to extend it for $\mathrm{char}(\Delta)=2^l$, and maybe even for $\mathrm{char}(\Delta)=0$.

    \subsection{Gelfand conjecture}
    In 2022 the remarkable connection between PI-theory (to be more precisely Grishin's methods) and Gelfand Conjecture stated at ICM’70 (see \cite{Gelfand}) was found.
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{conjecture*}[Gelfand]
        The homology of the Lie subalgebra of finite codimension in the Lie algebra of algebraic vector fields on an affine algebraic manifold are finite-dimensional in each
        homological degree.
    \end{conjecture*}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    This interesting connection was found during joint conversation between A.S.\ Khoroshkin, A.Ya. Kanel-Belov and with a little help of author.
    One can find Khoroshkin's sketch in \cite{Feigin}, \cite{Centrone}.
    Also we will use results from author's last year's coursework about finitely based $T$-spaces of commutative polynomials.


    \section{Preliminaries}

    \subsection{Profinite objects}
    Let us remind the reader of the classical definitions of the profinite groups theory.
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        Inverse (projective) limit of finite groups is called a profinite group.
        In the case of finite $p$-groups we get pro-$p$ group.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    It is clear that profinite groups can be equipped with the topology induced by the Tikhonov's product topology.

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        The free pro-$p$ group $F_p(X)$ is the completion of the discrete free group $F(X)$ with respect to a topology defined by all normal subgroups $N \subseteq F(X)$ whose indices are equal to the order of $p$ and which contain almost all generators of $F(X)$.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    One can define the free pro-$p$ group in a classical way using universal property in the category of pro-$p$ groups.

    Also note that if $\Delta$ is a pro-$p$ ring as defined in introduction, and $I$ is a maximal ideal.
    Then
    \[ \Delta = \varprojlim \Delta/I^n \]

    \subsection{PI-theory}
    Now let us give some base definitions of PI-theory.

    Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero and $F = k\langle x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots\rangle$ be a free, countably generated, associative algebra over a field $k$ and $T$ be the endomorphism (substitution) semigroup of $F$. $X = \{ x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots\}$\\
    Now let us give some classical definitions.

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        An endomorphism $\tau$ of $F$ defined by the rule $x_i \mapsto g_i, g_i \in F$, is called a substitution of type
        $(x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots) \mapsto (g_1,\ldots,g_i,\ldots)$.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        $T$-space in $F$ is a vector subspace of $F$, that is closed under substitutions.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        $T$-ideal in $F$ is an ideal of F that is at the same time a $T$-space.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        We say that $T$-space $M$ is finitely based if there is a finite subset $B\subset M$ such that T-space generated by $B$ coincides with $M$.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    During the 1980s, A.R.\ Kemer's resolution of Specht problem was a significant breakthrough in the PI-theory (\cite{Kemer}, see also simplified version of Kemer's proof in \cite{SimpleKemer}, \cite{Procesi}):

    Here is a well known reformulation of Kemer's theorem:

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{theorem*}
        Any $T$-ideal of the algebra $F$ is finitely based.
    \end{theorem*}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    It's natural to ask the same question for $T$-spaces.

    In 2001, V.V. Shchigolev combined Grishin (\cite) and Kanel-Belov's (\cite) methods.
    Then Shchigolev noticed that methods similar to Kemer's can be applied to localisation of Specht problem for the T-spaces.
    And finally he proved (\cite{Shchigolev}):

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{theorem*} [V.V. Shchigolev, 2001]
        Any $T$-space of the algebra F is finitely based.
    \end{theorem*}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    We will use one simple special case of Shchigolev's theorem, which was also proven in author's last year's coursework.


    \section{Main results}

    \subsection{Zubkov's approach}
    The first non-trivial idea is using the following definition:
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{definition}
        Let $F$ be a free pro-$p$ group, and $G$ be a pro-$p$ group.
        Then every $1\neq w\in F$ such that $w\in Ker(\varphi)$ for all continuous homomorphisms $\varphi: F\to G$ is called a pro-$p$ identity of G.
    \end{definition}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent


    \subsection{Ben-Ezra and Zelmanov's approach}



    \subsection{Gelfand's conjecture}
    We are going to consider one special case of Shchigolev's result (\cite):
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{theorem}
        Any  $T$-space in algebra $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is finitely based.
    \end{theorem}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    Then we will discuss Gelfand's conjecture.

    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{conjecture*}
        The homology of the Lie subalgebra of finite codimension in the Lie algebra of algebraic vector fields on an affine algebraic manifold are finite-dimensional in each
        homological degree.
    \end{conjecture*}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent


    We denote by $\mathcal{W}_n$ the Lie algebra of formal vector fields on an n-dimensional plane $V$.\\
    Well known that
    \[\mathcal{W}_n\simeq \prod\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}S^k V\otimes V^*\]
    The subalgebras $\prod\limits_{k=d}^{\infty}S^k V\otimes V^*$ of a finite codimension are denoted by $L_d(n)$.
    Using the classical considerations of homological algebra (which will be omitted), one can reduce Gelfand's conjecture to the following lemma
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent
    \begin{lemma}
        Any finitely generated $L_d(n)$-module is Noetherian.
    \end{lemma}
    \vskip 0.1in\noindent

    Finally, we will notice that the methods from the theorem ... can be applied to prove this lemma.
